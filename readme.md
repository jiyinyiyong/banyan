# Banyan is a loader for browser-side JavaScript

### Goal

It's cool to modularize client-side JS like writing Node app.  
And why do people write `define` or use AMD syntax?  
If that's for speed, it worth writing that,  
but when speed is not that important, why create one more indetation?

By now Banyan only works in Chrome. Other formats aren't read rightly.
